# TsinghuaNetUWP (codename)

This is my fork of [TsinghuaNet](https://github.com/OpportunityLiu/TsinghuaNet) project.

My goal is to research the "notification service" block and the "background tasks" block.

I plan to use this app's "design language" (black "metro-style" background, etc.) and "architecture patern" :)
